# A YAML list of all machinery modules Cuckoo will be using. Machines for each of the modules
# specified here have to be configured in their respective configuration

# machineries:
#   - machinery1
#   - machinery2
machineries:

# The resultserver is a Cuckoo component that running analysis machines upload their results to
# it should be reachable from the analysis machine. A resultserver will be started on the configured
# listen IP and port. Make sure the IP is off a network interface that is part of the analysis machine network or
# route/forward traffic between the analysis machines and the resultserver.

  listen_ip: {{ resultserver.listen_ip }}
  listen_port: {{ resultserver.listen_port }}
