# A YAML list of all machinery modules that should be enabled and Cuckoo will be using. Machines for
# each of the modules specified here have to be configured in their respective configuration file
# in the conf/machineries directory. It is only possible to run multiple machinery modules if their underlying
# virtualization layers do not interfere with each other.
# Example:
#
# machineries:
#   - machinery1
#   - machinery2
machineries:
  {% for machinery in machineries -%}
    - {{ machinery }}
  {% endfor %}
# The resultserver is a Cuckoo component that running analysis machines upload their results to
# it should be reachable from the analysis machine. A resultserver will be started on the configured
# listen IP and port. Make sure the IP is off a network interface that is part of the analysis machine network or
# route/forward traffic between the analysis machines and the resultserver.
resultserver:
  listen_ip: {{ resultserver.listen_ip }}
  listen_port: {{ resultserver.listen_port }}
