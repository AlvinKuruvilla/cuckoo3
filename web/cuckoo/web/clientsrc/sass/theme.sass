// This stylesheet applies 'generic' style tweaks. An edit is considered
// generic if it would change one occurence for a specific reason which would
// not make it a dynamic tweak if other applications would break because of
// that fix. An example is the Cuckoo logo, which has to be pushed a tiny
// bit down to look visually ok.
